## Overview

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover, monitor, and protect sensitive data in your AWS environment.

Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets for security and access control. Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets for your organization.
